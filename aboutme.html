        <h1> More About Me</h1>

        <p> Hello! My name is Reese Patwell, a beginner network specialist, and senior at the University of South Florida, set to graduate in May 2025 with a B.S. in Information Science. I currently live in the Tampa-Saint Petersburg area, and I’m all about networks and security! Whether it’s configuring a firewall or diving into network troubleshooting, I enjoy every bit of the process! <br><br>

            When I was younger, a sense of wonder around how the internet works inspired me to learn more about technology; with this decision leading me to study at University of South Florida. Coming from a military family, having both of my parents served in the Marine Corps, I was taught the importance of perseverance and teamwork at a young age. This upbringing combined with my passion for tech have instilled me with a sense of discipline, work ethic, and commitment to my goals; with these skills becoming the foundation of my life that led me through many things such as sports, hobbies, education, jobs, and more. <br><br>
            
            During my time at USF, I’ve been thrilled to learn new tools and technologies, picking up valuable skills across a variety of fields. My coursework has taken me through everything from data analytics and object-oriented programming, to database management and UX/UI design as well as more practical fields such as critical thinking and intelligence analysis. Along the way, I’ve become proficient in languages like R, Python, C++, SQL, and HTML/CSS/JS. Plus, I’m currently studying for my CompTIA Network+ certification, which has given me a solid foundation of network configuration, troubleshooting, server management, and firewall setup! <br><br>
            
            I’ve had the opportunity to work with a variety of tools that have greatly enhanced my understanding of network administration, development, and troubleshooting. Tools like RStudio, MySQL and VSCode have sharpened my programming and development skills, while platforms like GitHub and Jira have helped me manage and collaborate on projects efficiently. Additionally, I am familiar with simulating network environments with VM’s, and command lines and PuTTY for device management. Wireshark overall is my favorite tool for analyzing and troubleshooting network traffic, giving me in-depth experience with packet inspection and protocol analysis. I’m constantly excited to explore new technologies and refine my skills, as the world of networking evolves rapidly, and staying on the cutting edge is key to success. <br><br>
            While much of my work experience has been in the hospitality industry, it’s given me a strong foundation in customer service, communication, and leadership. I’ve worked in a variety of roles, from being a bell/valet attendant at the Don Cesar, to an assistant catering manager at Chick-fil-A, and a footwear specialist at Fit2Run. Through it all, I’ve learned how to collaborate effectively, and approach every situation with a new perspective. Now, I’m ready to transition these skills into the networking world, bringing my creativity and enthusiasm to every challenge I face! <br><br>
